# My personal website

Welcome to my personal website that contains an introduction of me, my background, goals, interests, hobbies, resume, 
and a portfolio of projects. I developed a strong interest in technology at a young age and, after a long career 
in the aviation and space industry, I never stopped exploring new interess and hobbies. One of those interests was coding 
and software development. Over time, I discovered a genuine passion for it, which grew into the desire to make a career pivot 
into the field.

I am currently based in Arlington, Texas, and work for a small robotics startup. Originally from San Angelo, I’ve lived in several 
places across Texas and enjoy staying connected to the state’s tech and innovation scene. I am actively transitioning into software
development, cloud computing, and ultimately machine learning and AI engineering. In July, I completed a year-long Machine Learning 
and AI bootcamp, where I studied complex concepts and built several projects. I am now pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computing
Applications through Texas Tech University, sharpening my skills in Python, Linux, command-line tools, SQL, and algorithms. 
Alongside my studies, I am preparing for industry certifications and building portfolio projects that showcase my progress. 
Though I’m making this pivot later in life, I’m energized and committed to a long future in technology—focused on solving 
problems, building meaningful software, and contributing to the growing world of AI.
