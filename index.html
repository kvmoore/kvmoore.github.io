        <p>
            I realized at young age that I had strong interest in tech. After a long career in the aviation, and space industry, I never stopped exploring new interests<br>
            and hobbies. One of those interests was coding and software development. Over time, I discovered a genuine passion for it, which grew into the desire<br>
            to make a career pivot into the field. I understood that achieving this would require formal course work, and I was excited to learn about Texas Tech's<br>
            new online degree program in Computing Applications, which fits perfectly with my full-time work schedule and life responsibilities
            My goals for this degree plan are to gain a solid foundation in the latest concepts in this field and how to apply them. I also want to brush up on my thinking<br>
            writing, problem solving and communication skills. I see this program as a great stepping stone into a new career this field. I want this degee to serve as <br>
            both a personal accomplishment and a professional qualification that will open doors to new opportunities.
