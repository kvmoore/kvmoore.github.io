<h3>System health Monitor</h3>

<p>This project is a proactive infrastructure monitoring tool designed to act as a 24/7 guardian for your server’s health. By building a Python-based script that tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage, you create a system that logs performance data and triggers immediate email alerts the moment critical thresholds are breached. It’s a quintessential "Junior DevOps" rite of passage that bridges the gap between manual system administration and modern automation, challenging you to manage configurations, containerize environments with Docker, and schedule tasks on a live VM. Essentially, you aren’t just writing code; you’re building a safety net that ensures hardware bottlenecks never catch you (or your users) off guard.</p>

<h3>Log analyzer</h3>

<p>The Log File Analyzer is a critical diagnostic tool designed to transform raw, unstructured system logs into actionable intelligence. By building a script that systematically parses massive log files to count specific error codes, detect unusual spikes in activity (anomalies), and generate a clean summary report, you are simulating the core investigative workflow of a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). This project demonstrates your ability to automate the "needle in a haystack" problem—efficiently identifying system failures or security threats amidst thousands of lines of data—and provides stakeholders with a high-level view of system health without them ever having to look at a terminal.</p>

<h3>Automated Backup Script</h3>

<p>The Automated Backup Script is your first line of defense against the "everything went wrong" scenario, serving as a reliable insurance policy for critical system data. By automating the process of identifying vital files, compressing them into efficient archives (like .tar.gz or .zip), and securely transferring them to a remote server or cloud storage, you eliminate the catastrophic risk of human forgetfulness. This project pushes you into the realm of Data Integrity, challenging you to handle versioning, implement error checking to confirm successful transfers, and manage sensitive credentials securely—solidifying your reputation as a "fail-safe" engineer who values business continuity above all else.</p>
